Sphinx RestructedText Files used e.g. in Online-Help for C++ Projects. The Plugin does not provide a builder for
Sphinx Projects, the Plugin integrates Sphinx with

* Editor support
* Build output parsing
* Preview of HTML Sphinx Builder output


The plugin is activated for Sphinx Restructured Text files with the exentions "*.rst"

A specific Editor for these Files is registered in QtCreator. To open other files, just open the files with the apropriate "Sphinx Editor".

The Plugin registgers output Parsers for Sphinx warnings and errors. These could be enabled in the Project configuration of your project.

Project specific previews could be configured to view content of Sphinx files after build together with the source file.
